# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

The overview of this analysis was to determine the the total rides, total fares, averages per ride and average per driver by city type (Rural, Suburban and Urban) and get a multiple line plot showing the fares for each type of city in a specific date.

Results: 


The basic differences is that in the first table we just compare the total amount of rides and fares and it's respective average fare per driver and ride and in the second chart we show the amount of fare in USD in each city type segmented in a period fo time in weeks.
